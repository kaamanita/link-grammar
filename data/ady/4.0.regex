% The regexes here use the PCRE2 pattern syntax.
% The LG library must be configured with PCRE2 in order to use them.

% Punctuation characters are getting strip from start and end of words,
% and words that contain punctuation are getting split at them. See the
% "any/affix-punc" file.
% These punctuation characters will match here. The \x03 is to match
% subscripted punctuation that may be specified in this file.
ANY-PUNCT: /^[[:punct:]]+(:?\x03|$)/

% Simple two-part random morphology: match any string of one or more
% letters as a stem, and the rest as a suffix.
% We are currently using .= to denote the end of a stem (the \x03
% is the internal representation of the dot in .=).
SIMPLE-STEM: /^\X+\x03=$/
SIMPLE-SUFF: /^=\X+/

% Reject anything that contains punctuation, so that the tokenizer will
% have a chance to split them off as affixes.
ANY-WORD: /^[^[:punct:]]+$/

% The regexes below don't need the PCRE2 regex library, but:
% 1. They work fine only with ASCII.
% 2. They are not checked to work fine with the latest changes
%    to the other configuration files.
% ANY-WORD:  /^[[:alnum:]]+$/
% ANY-PUNCT:  /^[[:punct:]]+$/
% SIMPLE-STEM: /^[[:alnum:]]+.=/
% SIMPLE-SUFF: /=[[:alnum:]]+$/

% Match anything that doesn't match the above.
% Match anything that isn't white-space.
% Well ... actually, reject anything that contains
% punctuation. We do this, so that the tokenizer can split off the
% the affixes (trailing commas, etc) correctly.
JUNK: !/[[:punct:]]/
JUNK: /^/
